# Sorting Algorithms

This repository contains various sorting algorithms implemented in [language]. Sorting algorithms are fundamental to computer science and play a crucial role in arranging elements in a specific order efficiently.

## Algorithms Included

### 1. Bubble Sort
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

### 2. Selection Sort
Selection sort sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.

### 3. Insertion Sort
Insertion sort builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time by repeatedly picking the next element and placing it in the correct order.

### 4. Merge Sort
Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.

### 5. Quick Sort
Quick sort is also a divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a 'pivot' element from the array and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

## Usage

Each algorithm is implemented in its respective file.
